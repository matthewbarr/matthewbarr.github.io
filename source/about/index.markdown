This is just the stuff that Iâ€™ve been working, and things that I need to have out there, so that search engines can find them.

 

Most of this will be related to Sysadmin & Devops Automation:
Could be: 

* RHEL/Redhat/Centos/fedora
* Ubuntu
 

And will probably have something to do w/:

* CI,
* Puppet
* configuration management
* etc

Yes, I do this for a living.  I probably even consult if you really want to pay me, too :)


I am a maintainter on [puppet-jenkins](https://github.com/jenkinsci/puppet-jenkins), and have commited code to various projects, including logstash, puppet, and various puppetlabs puppet modules.
