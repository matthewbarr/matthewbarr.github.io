So, i've been doing some work that others might care about.

I'll probably expand these into their own things, but i want them out of my head:

1. Jenkins - puppet module.  Auto slave

2. Best practices for puppet modules: parameters?  How configurable?  Do we use parameters into the deeper parts, or can you use scoped variables? enterprise puppet modules:  repo's? code reusue?

3. module for puppet parseing?  should be trivial?  Maybe a Mergatron module for jenkins? or a long writeup of how to get it working from an ops perspective.

4. Meta modules discussion.  Compare the literature, from http://www.craigdunn.org/2012/05/239/

& to the lego brick :  http://sysadvent.blogspot.com/2012/12/day-13-configuration-management-as-legos.html
