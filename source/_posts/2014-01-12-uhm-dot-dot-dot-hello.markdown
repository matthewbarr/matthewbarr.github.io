So, this is the new blog.  I'm hoping to talk about some of the things currently going on professionally, between puppet work, some inputs from #monitoringsucks responses, and various other things.

I'm probably going to flit from topic to topic, and may post some of my code that I'm working.

I'm also intersted in how to effectivly build new systes in a resilient fashion, inside AWS. 

Somewhere in there, we may even have to build a dashboard for self service.


Coming up, in no particular order:

* heira_params - because I don't want to bother with an ENC.
* puppet resillancy with a multi-AZ & multi-region app.
* App redundancy for the same..  or how to survive an AWS zone/region outage
* metrics, monitoring, and more.
